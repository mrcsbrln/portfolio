    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Java is, in many ways, C++–. (Michael Feldman) PHP is a minor evil
      perpetrated and created by incompetent amateurs, whereas Perl is a great
      and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted professionals.
      (Jon Ribbens) One man’s crappy software is another man’s full-time job.
      (Jessica Gaston) Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the
      first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you
      are–by definition–not smart enough to debug it. (Brian Kernighan)
